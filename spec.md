# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
        I created a CLI app that lets users type commands to scrape a site, list the job postings, and view details about each posting.
- [x] Pull data from an external source
        My CLI app pulls data from ycombinator Hacker News posts and parses the HTML.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
        After scraping a Hacker News post, users are presented with a list of job postings and can then type a number corresponding with the ID of the job posting to view details.
